# ℹ️ Background
Some university requires students to upload the certificates they acquired throughout the semester on different platforms. Most of the time this is done using google forms. This whole process gets very cumbersome and the database is also difficult to manage for the faculty. To overcome this hurdle, we designed this Web app. 

# 📃 Features
This Web app targets two categories of users: Students and Faculties.
## Features for Students: 
1. They can upload their certificates in their respective categories
2. They can check their uploaded certificate's acceptance status 
3. Reupload a denied certificate.

## Features for Faculties:
1. They can see submissions made by students
2. They can check the authenticity of the certificates
3. They can classify certificates into their respective categories
4. They can see submissions of a targeted student
5. They can oversee the number of pending submissions along with these students' details
